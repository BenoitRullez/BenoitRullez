- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenoitRullez but just call me Benoit.
- 👀 I’m interested in running a Rpi with Home Assistant to control my home smart devices, and a media server based on Servarr suite and Plex.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on Home assistant and Sonoff integration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Sonoff integration in HA.
- 📫 How to reach me ... no sure ... send me vibes!
